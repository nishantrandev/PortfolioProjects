# Time Series Analysis â€“ Global Temperature Data (1995-2020)

## Introduction

This project conducts time series analysis on the average daily temperature of different cities worldwide from 1995 to 2020. The primary goals include analyzing overall trends, identifying key moments, handling outliers, and comparing average temperatures across regions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is a Geo-Spatial Time-Series Dataset representing the average temperature recorded across 321 cities worldwide at specific times from 1995 to 2020. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x0wdlwbf8bi3vxk6wzk73/dataset.csv?rlkey=yqley7ssyvt6ws4p2y5ev5hcl&dl=0)

## Tasks and Analysis

### Task 1: Importing and Overview
- Importing the dataset.
- Data representation: Geo-Spatial Time-Series.

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing
- Selection of relevant columns.
- Histogram analysis of average temperatures.
- Removal of outliers (temperatures less than -40).
- Sorting values by Year, Month, and Day.

### Task 3: Global Temperature Analysis (1995-2019)
- Aggregation based on the year.
- Line chart visualization of global average temperature.
- Linear regression for trend analysis.
- Identification of overall trends and key moments.

### Task 4: Regional Comparison
- Comparison of yearly average temperatures across different regions.
- Identification of hottest and coldest regions.
- Analysis of temperature change trends in regions.

### Task 5: Monthly Analysis in Canada
- Extraction and aggregation of monthly average temperatures in Canada.
- Bar chart and box plot visualization for detailed analysis.
- Identification of hottest and coldest months, and detection of outliers.

## Key Findings

1. **Overall Trend Analysis:**
   - The global average temperature exhibits an upward trend from 1995 to 2019.

2. **Regional Comparison:**
   - Africa consistently has the highest average temperatures, while Europe remains the coldest.
   - The Middle East shows the highest increase in average temperatures over the entire range.

3. **Monthly Analysis in Canada:**
   - July is the hottest month in Canada.
   - January appears to be the coldest, with some values below -10.
   - Outliers, such as April 2018, are identified.

## Conclusion

This time series analysis provides valuable insights into global temperature patterns. The identified trends and regional variations contribute to a comprehensive understanding of temperature dynamics from 1995 to 2020.
