# Gravity Book Store Database Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on querying and analyzing the Gravity Book Store Database, showcasing skills in SQL for data extraction and analysis. The database contains information about books, authors, customers, orders, and various other entities related to a fictional book store.

## Skills Showcased

1. **SQL Querying:** Demonstrated proficiency in writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the database.

2. **Data Analysis:** Utilized SQL queries to perform data analysis on various aspects, including languages of books, top authors, book lengths, and customer behaviors.

3. **Window Functions:** Implemented window functions such as RANK() and ROW_NUMBER() to analyze data within specific partitions.

4. **Subqueries:** Employed subqueries to handle more complex logic, such as identifying books with multiple orders or finding books published on the same date.

5. **Data Filtering and Sorting:** Utilized WHERE clauses and ORDER BY clauses to filter and sort data for a clearer presentation.
